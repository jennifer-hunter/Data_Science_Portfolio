Hyperrealistic photograph: A tranquil coastal village captured in 8K resolution, ultra-detailed, professional photography. Traditional Mediterranean houses with terracotta roofs are nestled into lush green hillsides. Their whitewashed walls catch the soft golden glow of the setting sun during the enchanting golden hour. Vibrant bougainvillea cascades from balconies, while locals in casual, summery attire stroll along cobblestone paths, embodying a relaxed lifestyle vibe. The scene exudes an authentic, non-posed atmosphere, celebrating the harmonious intersection of architecture and nature.
