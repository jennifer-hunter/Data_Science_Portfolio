Each country only has one total object count, so when I force the data into ten count ranges, each country falls into one range only. This means each row has one coloured square and the rest are zeros. The plot ends up looking empty, even though the code is doing what it should be doing.\n",

    "## Summary: Looking at the result and why the heatmap is still not the optimal visualisation\n",
    "\n",
    "The heatmap works technically, and this time it really is a proper 10\u00d710 grid. Each country now has values across several time periods instead of just one, so the plot finally behaves like a true heatmap rather than a single coloured cell per row.\n",
    "\n",
    "But even so, the result is still quite hard to read. A few reasons for this became obvious as soon as I saw the output:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The distribution of objects over time is very uneven. Some countries (like Greece and Egypt) have large clusters in certain periods, while others barely appear.\n",
    "- Many cells are zero, which creates a patchy pattern with a lot of empty white space.\n",
    "- The ranges are still very broad (thousands of years in some bins), so countries with long histories end up dominating the visual, while others remain sparse.\n",
    "- Museums naturally collect unevenly across time, meaning some periods have far more surviving material than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means the data itself is not evenly shaped for heatmapping. A heatmap works best when both axes have fairly balanced variation. Here, the \u201ccountry\u201d axis is strong, but the \u201ctime period\u201d axis is highly skewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though this version is much better than the earlier experiments, it still shows that country-by-time-period is not the clearest way to view the data. This is useful in itself: it tells me that not every dataset naturally suits a heatmap, and the structure of the data matters just as much as the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point I'm going to stop the heatmap experimentation. I think a choropleth map will give a cleaner and more meaningful view of the data at country level, especially once I have the combined dataset from the group. When that file is ready, I\u2019ll move on to trying the Folium approach for mapping the countries geographically.\n"
